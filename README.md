# Being Spotify ðŸŽµ

## Overview
Being Spotify is a lightweight, web-based music player built using Vite, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. The basic idea was to **clone Spotify's UI** while adapting it into a style that makes it a **useful and practical website** for managing and playing songs. It allows users to browse, play, and organize playlists seamlessly through a clean and responsive interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Playlists**: Organize songs into multiple playlists.  
- **Interactive Playbar**: Play, pause, and navigate between songs while displaying currently playing song info.  
- **Responsive UI**: Works across desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Customizable Songs**: Add or update songs and playlists easily through environment variables.  
- **Sleek Song Cards**: Display song details including artist names dynamically.

## How It Works
- Songs and playlists are stored in JSON format and loaded dynamically by the app.  
- The playbar updates in real-time to reflect the currently playing song.  
- Clicking on a playlist filters the displayed songs, making navigation intuitive and fast.  

## Tech Stack
- **Vite** â€“ Fast frontend build tool  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** â€“ App logic and DOM manipulation  
- **HTML5 & CSS3** â€“ Layout and styling  

## Future Enhancements
- Search functionality to quickly find songs.
